# NL2Bash

## Overview

This repository contains the data and source code release of the paper: [NL2Bash: A Corpus and Semantic Parser for
Natural Language Interface to the Linux Operating System](http://victorialin.net/pubs/nl2bash.pdf).

Specifically, it contains the following components:

1. A set of ~10,000 bash one-liners collected from websites such as StackOverflow and their English descriptions written by Bash programmers.
2. Tensorflow implementations of the following translation models:
   - the standard [Seq2Seq](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) and [CopyNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06393) models
   - a stage-wise nl‚ü∂Bash model using argument filling heuristics ([Lin et. al. 2017](http://victorialin.net/pubs/tellina_tr_2017.pdf)).
3. A bash command parser which parses a bash command into an abstractive syntax tree, developed on top of  [bashlex](https://github.com/idank/bashlex).
4. A set of domain-specific natural language processing tools, including a regex-based sentence tokenizer and a bash-domain named entity recognizer.

As of June 4th, 2018, the repository also contains three derivations of 
component #1. One contains additional data that went through a more stringent
verification process, one removes some erroneous one-liners from the original
dataset, and one applies both the addition and subtraction operations.

## Experiment Setup

### Install TensorFlow

The Tensorflow library is required to reproduce our experiments. The experiment results can be reproduced on machines with or without GPUs.

Please follow the instructions on the [official website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the library.

The following pip installation command has been tested on Mac OS 10.10.5.
```
sudo pip3 install --upgrade \
 https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.3.0-py3-none-any.whl 
```

### Environment Variables & Dependencies
First of all, run `make` in the root directory of the repo.
```
(sudo) make
```
This sets up the Python path and other tools on which the main experiment depends.

Then change to the [experiments](/experiments) folder and follow the instructions there to reproduce our results.
```
cd experiments
```
